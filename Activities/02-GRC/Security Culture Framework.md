## Security Culture Framework - Part 1 and 2

In this exercise, you'll play the role of a security consultant who's been contracted to help a local bank develop a plan to address a physical security issue that recently resulted in the breach of its financial data servers.

Refer to this memo from the executive team:

  - _Employees have been observed holding the door open for others behind them when accessing the building, without each employee scanning their own individual badge._  
  
    _The organization has determined that this behavior has led to several non-employees gaining unauthorized and undocumented access to several offices. With over 500 current employees, you can imagine how this might introduce serious issues._
  
    _Crucially, the Incident Response team recently identified that an attacker was able to steal confidential financial data from the servers in the Finance department. These machines are not connected to the internet, so the breach must have resulted from physical access to the Finance machines._

  You'll develop a full plan for addressing this problem throughout the day. 
  
  To begin, apply the first step of the security culture framework: Measuring and Setting Goals.
### Instructions

  1. Explain the security risks that this behavior introduces.

    - This behavior is insecure because it enables non-employees to get into the building without providing identification.

  2. Describe a method for finding out how many people encourage tailgating, and keeping track of those who do.
    - One method involves simply counting how many employees engage in this behavior.

    - The organization should have the security team audit surveillance feeds to determine what percentage of employees entering secure buildings hold the door for people behind them. 

    - They can also keep track of which employees let others in. This number is the average tailgating rate, which can be calculated for each secure building the company manages.

  3. Set a goal for how many employees _should_ engage in this behavior.

    - Ideally, no employees entering secure buildings will allow unauthorized people in. The target should be 0% of employees engaging in tailgating.

  4. Identify three potential high-level solutions to this problem, such as training or hiring guards. Note one advantage and disadvantage for each.

    - **Develop and deliver a training**. The advantage is that this training might have a lasting effect on the company's security. The disadvantage is that it takes a long time to develop and execute.

    - **Hire guards for all hours**. The advantage is that this provides a direct solution to the problem. The disadvantage is that it raises costs, and doesn't change how employees think about the problem.

    - **Require keycards for access**. This is the most secure option, because it restricts access to only those who have been explicitly allowed to enter. The disadvantage is that it takes a lot of work to implement.

  5. Set an estimated timeline for each potential solution.

    - The company has over 500 employees. Training all of them will probably take a full year.

    - Hiring and assigning guards would be faster. This only takes as long as getting the budget approved and hiring the security personnel. At most, this should take one quarter (three months).

    - Developing and implementing key card access would require at least a year, as it requires physical changes to the organization's properties and distributing ID cards. 


- All companies have a leadership team. What C-level officer titles do you know? Which do you think this company has?

  - Most companies relevant to this course have a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Finance Officer (CFO), and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

- What security functions/responsibilities does a Security department have?

  - The Security department is responsible for protecting the CIA of the organization's data.

- Which teams within the department would fulfill these responsibilities?

  - Most security teams have at least Incident Response and Networking teams. Companies that build their own applications usually have an Application Security team as well.

6. **Make an Action Plan**:   
  - Schedule quarterly trainings.
  - Design and develop training.
  - Implement quarterly training.
  - Evaluate impact after each training.
  - Evaluate overall impact after one year.

7. **Schedule**: The security and HR teams decided that _quarterly_ trainings made the most sense.

8. **Metrics and KPIs**: The security team wants 0% of employees to allow tailgating after the training is complete.

9. **Measurements**: One month after each quarter's training, security personnel will audit security cameras and identify employees who allow others to tailgate. 

    - Those who have already been through training will be disciplined. Those who follow training guidelines will be rewarded. Those who have not yet been trained will be notified that they should stop, but will _not_ be disciplined.. 
    - Be detailed. For instance, if you're going to contract a pentesting company, explain exactly what you'll have them do.
