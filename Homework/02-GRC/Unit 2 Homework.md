***Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture***
___
This week we learned about security culture and how to promote it within organizations.
It’s important that all employees are aware of common security risks and treat security seriously. The majority of cyberattacks aim to exploit human weaknesses with methods like phishing.
For this reason, people are most often the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses.
___
Scenario

- Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work.

- Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones.

- Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.

- Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications.

- You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.
___

Step 1: Measure and Set Goals

Answer the following questions:

- Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

    - Attack 1 - Impersonation
        - If an employee’s device is lost or stolen, an attacker can easily access the sensitive information that’s on the device. The attacker would be able to  impersonate the employee and make requests.
    - Attack 2 - Malware
        - Employees that use personal devices to download different types of information and files can be a problem. Games and other things can have hidden viruses or malware. The virus or malware could be passed to the company network. It’s all just a disaster. 
    - Attack 3 - Data Theft
        - If the employee’s personal account has been hacked, there is the potential that the corporate data and confidential information can be exposed. This could also be from a lost or stolen device. 

- Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources.

    - Data Theft - If the employees are working from home, then they should be able to access work files through only secured networks.
    - Malware - The company can offer the employees to install anti-malware software onto their personal devices.
    - Impersonation - Having two-factor authentication when the employee logs in to access work files 

- What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently not behaving according to the preferred behavior? For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders.

    - Annual and random phone audits
        - Make sure the phone is up to date
        - Search for company files and find where they are located in the phone
    - Conduct a survey to see how much knowledge employees have about the importance of security

- What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.
    - To achieve about 99% compliance. This will help us avoid having to deal with security breaches due to the use of personal phones by the employees. 

___

Step 2: Involve the Right People

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved? Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.

- CEO	
    - The CEO will provide information on the state of the company. They will also be the liaison for the Board of Directors. They will include various parties that are involved in the company’s operations and its plans for the future, 
- CIO
    - They will help implement technological aspects of any plan for example installing anti-malware software
- CFO
  - The CFO will help with the financial side of things. They will see if the company is financially capable of implementing new company policies. 
- COO
    - The COO will educate the employees about security threats. This will ensure that they are aware of the different steps that can be taken to prevent them. 
- Human Resources
    - Human resources will ensure that the employees are attending the mandatory training. They will follow up with all employees to make sure that they are following procedures. 

___

Step 3: Training Plan

Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:

- How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)

    - Mandatory training will be conducted both in-person and online every six months. The training will be conducted both in-person and online. The C-Suite has to come in person and the employees will be online. The mandatory training will include surveys that assess how much the employees understand each topic that’s talked about. If some don’t understand what’s been talked about, then we can have review sessions. 
    - During the six months, there will be mini informative sessions that are mandatory. Those ones are online.
    - When new employees come and join the team, they will go through mandatory training and sessions to understand the security risks. Also to install different software onto their personal devices. 


- What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

    - The welcome orientation/training will be mandatory. That will include:
        - C-Suite officials will share information about the company’s past and current cyber threats. They will also discuss the measures that were taken to prevent previous incidents. 
        - Employees will get contact information of who to contact if they suspect a data breach, questionable emails, etc. 
        - Employees will also have to set up their personal devices so that they are able to work from home.
    - Mini Sessions will include:
        - Common types of hacking tricks with examples 
            - Malware, ransomware, code injection, brute force, etc
        - Phishing scams
            - Not to click unfamiliar links
            - The administration won’t ever ask employees to provide a password
        - External USB Policies
            - Encrypted USBs for work may be issued by the company
        - Make sure that every employee locks the device before leaving it.
            - Limits access to company information 
            - Keeps information protected
            - Make sure to report if the device is lost or stolen

- After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness?

    - To measure the awareness of the employee's surveys and quizzes will be conducted before, during, and after both types of sessions. These will be done to help assess if the employees understood and retained the information included in the sessions. This will also help with feedback. 
    - To measure the behavior of the employees, phishing attacks will be conducted to see the percentage of employees that feel into the trap

Bonus: Other Solutions

Training alone often isn't the entire solution to a security concern. Indicate at least two other potential solutions. For each one, indicate the following:

- What type of control is it? Administrative, technical, or physical?

    - VPN: Technical
    - Eliminating the use of personal devices to access company data: Administrative

- What goal does this control have? Is it preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating?

    - VPN: Preventative - this will only allow employees with certain credentials to have the opportunity to access company data.
    - Eliminating the use of personal devices to access company data: Deterrent - there’s the risk of employees to lose their jobs


- What is one advantage of each solution?

    - VPN: Employees will be able to use their personal devices anywhere they would like to.
    - Eliminating the use of personal devices to access company data: The employees won’t have the chance to expose any data. It will also help with any bad home security or habits. 


- What is one disadvantage of each solution?

    - VPN: Depending on the number of employees, accessibility would be time consuming
    - Eliminating the use of personal devices to access company data: Employees may not be as engaged on a work computer outside of work hours. This may impact the company in the long run.
